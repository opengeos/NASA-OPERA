# OpenGeoAgent

OpenGeoAgent is the QGIS plugin interface for GeoAgent. It adds a dockable,
project-aware AI assistant to QGIS and connects it to GeoAgent's QGIS tool
surface.

## Install

Install the plugin from the QGIS Plugin Manager by searching for
**OpenGeoAgent**. For local development, install or symlink the plugin directory
from `qgis_geoagent/open_geoagent` into your QGIS plugin profile.

Open the plugin from the QGIS toolbar or plugin menu, then use
**Settings > Dependencies** to install GeoAgent and provider clients into the
plugin-managed environment. The dependency tab is workflow-aware: install Core
Providers, WhiteboxTools, NASA Earthdata/OPERA, GEE Data Catalogs, STAC, or All
depending on the modes you use. QGIS itself remains provided by your desktop
QGIS installation. The QGIS Python runtime must be Python 3.11 or newer.

## Provider Setup

OpenGeoAgent supports the same provider families as GeoAgent:

- Bedrock
- OpenAI
- ChatGPT/Codex OAuth
- Anthropic
- Google Gemini
- Ollama
- LiteLLM

Use the settings panel to configure API keys, hosts, model defaults, and
dependency status. Vision features require a provider and model that support
image inputs.

## Sample Data

## Chat With QGIS

The chat dock is aware of the current QGIS project and active layer. It can
inspect project state, summarize layers, navigate the map canvas, add vector,
raster, and XYZ tile layers, select features, run QGIS Processing algorithms,
open attribute tables, and save projects.

Agent modes expose workflow-specific tools. STAC mode can read the current map
extent as a WGS84 search bbox, list catalog collections, search items, inspect
item assets, and add concrete raster asset URLs to QGIS when QGIS accepts the
asset directly. If the user does not name a catalog, STAC mode defaults to the
Planetary Computer STAC API. When the selected asset is a remote COG, the tool
passes the signed HTTP URL to QGIS through GDAL's `/vsicurl/` virtual filesystem
and queues raster creation in a QGIS background task before adding the validated
layer to the project and zooming to its extent. The QGIS status bar shows an
in-progress loading message while the background task is active. This follows
the loading pattern used by the qgis-stac plugin and avoids blocking the QGIS UI
while GDAL probes the remote COG. Search results include cloud cover, spatial-fit
metadata, and preferred raster asset URLs so common load workflows can skip an
extra asset-inspection turn. The full asset URL is recorded in the transcript.
STAC load task start, success, failure, and termination messages are also
written to the QGIS message log under `OpenGeoAgent STAC`. STAC mode hides the
generated PyQGIS script fallback so common search setup stays on dedicated
read-only tools. The chat dock's tool availability line shows which tools are
active for the selected mode and permission profile.

Examples:

- "Summarize all layers in this project."
- "Zoom to the active layer and describe its CRS and extent."
- "Select parcels where population is greater than 10000."
- "Add this raster and set its opacity to 60 percent."
- "Use a false color composite for the active NAIP layer."

## Images And Screenshots

OpenGeoAgent supports image attachments in chat messages. You can paste images
from the clipboard directly into the chat input, or use the screenshot menu to
attach visual context from QGIS.

Screenshot options include:

- capture the map canvas;
- select a region on the map canvas;
- capture the QGIS window;
- select a region on the screen.

Attached images appear as thumbnails in the chat. Click an image to open a
larger preview, then use the save action or context menu to export it.

When a multimodal model returns image content blocks, OpenGeoAgent writes those
image artifacts to a local temporary output directory, renders them inline in
the chat transcript, and includes Markdown image references when copying or
exporting the conversation.

OpenGeoAgent also exposes a `generate_image` tool for direct image creation
requests such as "generate a cat image." This tool uses the OpenAI Images API
and requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`; ChatGPT/Codex OAuth alone is not enough for this
API call. The default image model is `gpt-image-2`; choose another image model
in Settings > Model > Image Generation when needed. Generated files are saved
locally and rendered inline in the chat.
If verified image-model access belongs to a specific OpenAI organization or
project, set the optional OpenAI org/project IDs in the plugin settings so the
Images API request uses that verified context.

## PyQGIS Fallback

When a request needs QGIS API functionality that is not covered by a dedicated
GeoAgent tool, the agent can use the confirmation-gated `run_pyqgis_script`
fallback. The script runs in the QGIS GUI context with access to `iface`,
`project`, `canvas`, and `active_layer`.

This is useful for tasks such as raster band renderer changes, labeling
updates, layer tree adjustments, and other PyQGIS operations. The plugin asks
for confirmation before running the script.

Use **Copy Script** to copy the PyQGIS code that produced the result. The
copied snippet includes a QGIS-console-ready preamble so it can be inspected,
shared, or rerun.

## Copy And Review

The chat dock includes actions for copying the Markdown transcript and the most
recent executed PyQGIS script. These are intended for reproducibility,
debugging, and sharing workflows outside the plugin.

## Safety

OpenGeoAgent uses GeoAgent's confirmation hook for destructive, persistent, or
long-running operations. Actions such as deleting layers, saving projects,
running processing jobs, and executing fallback PyQGIS scripts require user
approval before they run unless the selected permission profile is
**Trusted auto-approve**, which is the first-run default. Select a narrower
profile such as Inspect only when you want to restrict tool access.
